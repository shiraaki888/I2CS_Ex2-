Description:
This project is used mainly to deal with 2D maps in the form of integer matrices.
For example: {{1,1,1},{1,0,1}} represents a small map where 1 is a wall and 0 is a path. 
In the end we visualiz the result in a GUI (like Pac-Man style).
This project deals with 2D Raster Maps and Pathfinding algorithms such as: 
drawRect- Draws a filled rectangle defined by opposite corners p1 and p2.
drawCircle - Draws a filled circle defined by a center point and a radius.
fill - Computes a flood fill (connected component) starting from p, changing the color to new_v. Returns the number of pixels changed.
shortestPath- Computes the shortest valid path between p1 and p2 using BFS, avoiding the obsColor.
allDistance - Computes a map where every pixel represents the distance from the start point.
and so on...
